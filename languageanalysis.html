<p>DRUG use in Australia is at an all-time high, and not in a good way. The number of methamphetamine users has tripled over the past five years to 268,000, the Medical Journal of Australia has just revealed, with 15- to 24-year-olds the fastest growing demographic.</p>

<p>We’re the biggest ecstasy users in the world, third in methamphetamine (including ice) use and fourth in cocaine use, according to the UN. One in 10 drivers stopped by police tests positive for illegal drugs.</p> 

<p>We are in the grips of a <div class="dropdown">crisis<span class="dropdowncontent">风波</span></div>. In a <div class="dropdown">sane<span class="dropdowncontent">头脑清楚/明智的
</span></div> world, we would return to the “tough on drugs” <div class="dropdown">regime<span class="dropdowncontent">政权
</span></div> of the Howard era, which launched the heroin <div class="dropdown">drought<span class="dropdowncontent">干旱
</span></div>, <div class="dropdown">slashed<span class="dropdowncontent">削减
</span></div> drug use and dramatically slowed the rate of experimentation by young people.</p>

<p>We would give up the <div class="dropdown">creeping<span class="dropdowncontent">爬行/蔓延
</span></div> drug liberalisation/harm minimisation regimen that has <div class="dropdown">taken root<span class="dropdowncontent">生根
</span></div> under the <div class="dropdown">malign<span class="dropdowncontent">诽谤/有害
</span></div> influence of the Greens and Alex Wodak, president of the Australian Drug Reform Foundation.</p> 

<p>After all, they are what has brought us to this <div class="dropdown">parlous<span class="dropdowncontent">陧
</span></div> state.</p> 

<p>But no, having laid the <div class="dropdown">foundations<span class="dropdowncontent">基础
</span></div> for the crisis, now they want more, laughably <div class="dropdown">blaming<span class="dropdowncontent">怪/责备
</span></div> “<div class="dropdown">prohibition<span class="dropdowncontent">禁止
</span></div>” for the increase in <div class="dropdown">addicts<span class="dropdowncontent">瘾
</span></div> and <div class="dropdown">overdose<span class="dropdowncontent">过量
</span></div>, when they’ve <div class="dropdown">ensured<span class="dropdowncontent">确保
</span></div> drug enforcement is <div class="dropdown">slacker<span class="dropdowncontent">松弛
</span></div> than ever.</p> 

<p>Greens leader Richard Di Natale and Senator Larissa Waters want ice <div class="dropdown">decriminalised<span class="dropdowncontent">合法化
</span></div> so the streets can be <div class="dropdown">overrun<span class="dropdowncontent">泛滥
</span></div> even more by violent addicts.</p> 

<p>Wodak has launched a <div class="dropdown">campaign<span class="dropdowncontent">运动
</span></div> for “party pill” testing at music festivals. He plans to force <div class="dropdown">confrontations<span class="dropdowncontent">面对
</span></div> with police, sending a green light to young people that taking illegal drugs and defying police is <div class="dropdown">noble<span class="dropdowncontent">高贵/高贵
</span></div>.</p> 

<p><div class="dropdown">Official<span class="dropdowncontent">正式/官
</span></div> pill testing is just decriminalisation in disguise. It places police in an <div class="dropdown">untenable<span class="dropdowncontent">成立
</span></div> position: get involved in a heavy-handed <div class="dropdown">confrontation<span class="dropdowncontent">面对
</span></div> or turn a blind eye and break the law themselves.</p>

<p>“It’s a situation <div class="dropdown">fraught<span class="dropdowncontent">误人子弟
</span></div> with danger and heightened emotional responses,” Police Association President, Scott Weber said yesterday. “The testing regimes … will not tell a potential drug user whether a substance is ‘safe’ or ‘unsafe’.”</p> 

<p>To his credit Police Minister Troy Grant has stood his ground, upholding the law and reflecting the values of most Australians.</p>

<p>But he was pilloried as a “hardline” dinosaur and misrepresented by the national broadcaster in its recent Four Corners program Dying to Dance. Grant’s was the only voice against pill-testing in the program, even though Dr Adrian Dunlop, Chief Addictions Medicine Specialist at NSW Health, had told Four Corners there was not enough evidence that pill testing would save lives. The ABC, as ever, just ran the Wodak line.</p>

<p>As Grant’s office points out, most of the program was <div class="dropdown">dedicated<span class="dropdowncontent">奉献
</span></div> to providing information on <div class="dropdown">procuring<span class="dropdowncontent">促成
</span></div> drugs, <div class="dropdown">smuggling<span class="dropdowncontent">走私
</span></div> drugs into festivals, showing users discussing “drug salad, yummy yummy”, retrieving drugs from inside orifices, and promoting drug use as “so much f ... ing fun”.</p> 

<p>As a former frontline police officer, Grant understands only too well the <div class="dropdown">scourge<span class="dropdowncontent">灾害
</span></div> of <div class="dropdown">illicit<span class="dropdowncontent">非法的
</span></div> drugs and the suffering it <div class="dropdown">inflicts<span class="dropdowncontent">造成
</span></div> on families. We are lucky he is holding the line.</p>
