      <p>Knowing that Mrs. Mallard was <span class="hover">afflicted<span class="translate">折磨</span></span> with a heart trouble, 
      great care was taken to <span class="hover">break to her as gently as possible the news<span class="translate">公布新闻</span></span> 
      of her husband's death.</p>
    
     <p>It was her sister Josephine who told her, in broken sentences; <span class="hover">veiled<span class="translate">隐藏</span></span> 
     <span class="hover">hints<span class="translate">暗示</span></span> that revealed in half 
     <span class="hover">concealing<span class="translate">隐藏</span></span>. Her husband's friend Richards was there, too, near her. 
     It was he who had been in the newspaper office when <span class="hover">intelligence<span class="translate">情报</span></span> of the railroad 
     <span class="hover">disaster<span class="translate">灾害</span></span> was received, with Brently Mallard's name leading the list of "killed." 
     He had only taken the time to <span class="hover">assure<span class="translate">担保</span></span> himself of its truth by a second 
     <span class="hover">telegram<span class="translate">电报</span></span>, and had <span class="hover">hastened<span class="translate">趋</span></span> 
     to <span class="hover">forestall<span class="translate">防止</span></span> any less careful, less <span class="hover">tender<span class="translate">温柔</span></span> 
     friend in <span class="hover">bearing<span class="translate">承担</span></span> the sad message.</p>
    
     <p>She did not hear the story as many women have heard the same, with a <span class="hover">paralyzed<span class="translate">瘫</span></span> 
     <span class="hover">inability<span class="translate">无能</span></span> to accept its <span class="hover">significance<span class="translate">重要</span></span>. 
     She <span class="hover">wept<span class="translate">泣</span></span> at once, with sudden, <span class="hover">wild<span class="translate">疯狂</span></span> 
     <span class="hover">abandonment<span class="translate">放弃</span></span>, in her sister's arms. When the storm of <span class="hover">grief<span class="translate">哀思</span></span> 
     had spent itself she went away to her room alone. She would have no one follow her.</p>
    
     <p>There stood, facing the open window, a comfortable, roomy <span class="hover">armchair<span class="translate">扶手椅/靠背椅</span></span>. 
     Into this she <span class="hover">sank<span class="translate">沉落</span></span>, pressed down by a physical 
     <span class="hover">exhaustion<span class="translate">虚脱</span></span> that <span class="hover">haunted<span class="translate">作祟</span></span> 
     her body and seemed to reach into her soul.</p>
    
     <p>She could see in the open square before her house the tops of trees that were all <span class="hover">aquiver<span class="translate">惶恐的</span></span> 
     with the new spring life. The delicious breath of rain was in the air. In the street below a <span class="hover">peddler<span class="translate">小贩</span></span> 
     was crying his <span class="hover">wares<span class="translate">器具</span></span>. 
     The notes of a distant song which some one was singing reached her <span class="hover">faintly<span class="translate">幽幽</span></span>, 
     and countless sparrows were <span class="hover">twittering<span class="translate">叽叽喳喳</span></span> in the 
     <span class="hover">eaves<span class="translate">屋檐</span></span>.</p>
    
     <p>There were patches of blue sky showing here and there through the clouds that had met and <span class="hover">piled<span class="translate">堆</span></span> 
     one above the other in the west facing her window.</p>
    
     <p>She sat with her head thrown back upon the <span class="hover">cushion<span class="translate">垫</span></span> of the chair, 
     quite <span class="hover">motionless<span class="translate">不动</span></span>, except when a <span class="hover">sob<span class="translate">泣</span></span> 
     came up into her <span class="hover">throat<span class="translate">咽喉</span></span> and <span class="hover">shook<span class="translate">抖动</span></span> her, 
     as a child who has <span class="hover">cried<span class="translate">哭</span></span> itself to sleep continues to sob in its dreams.</p>
    
     <p>She was young, with a fair, calm face, whose lines <span class="hover">bespoke<span class="translate">表明</span></span> 
     <span class="hover">repression<span class="translate">抑</span></span> and even a certain strength. 
     But now there was a <span class="hover">dull<span class="translate">枯燥</span></span> <span class="hover">stare<span class="translate">盯</span></span> 
     in her eyes, whose <span class="hover">gaze<span class="translate">注视</span></span> was <span class="hover">fixed<span class="translate">定</span></span> 
     away off <span class="hover">yonder<span class="translate">那边</span></span> on one of those patches of blue sky. 
     It was not a glance of <span class="hover">reflection<span class="translate">反射</span></span>, 
     but rather <span class="hover">indicated<span class="translate">表明</span></span> a 
     <span class="hover">suspension<span class="translate">暂停</span></span> of intelligent thought.</p>
    
     <p>There was something coming to her and she was waiting for it, <span class="hover">fearfully<span class="translate">可怕/伈</span></span>. 
     What was it? She did not know; it was too <span class="hover">subtle<span class="translate">细微</span></span> and 
     <span class="hover">elusive<span class="translate">易忘的</span></span> to name. 
     But she felt it, <span class="hover">creeping<span class="translate">爬行/蔓延</span></span> out of the sky, 
     reaching toward her through the sounds, the <span class="hover">scents<span class="translate">香味</span></span>, 
     the color that filled the air.</p>
    
     <p>Now her <span class="hover">bosom<span class="translate">怀/胸</span></span> rose and fell <span class="hover">tumultuously<span class="translate">骚动</span></span>. 
     She was beginning to <span class="hover">recognize<span class="translate">认识</span></span> this thing that was approaching to 
     <span class="hover">possess<span class="translate">控制</span></span> her, and she was <span class="hover">striving<span class="translate">努力</span></span> 
     to beat it back with her <span class="hover">will<span class="translate">意志</span></span> - as powerless as her two white 
     <span class="hover">slender<span class="translate">苗条</span></span> hands would have been.</p>
    
     <p>When she abandoned herself a little <span class="hover">whispered<span class="translate">耳语</span></span> word 
     <span class="hover">escaped<span class="translate">逃逸</span></span> her slightly parted lips. 
     She said it over and over under her breath: "free, free, free!" The 
     <span class="hover">vacant<span class="translate">空的</span></span> stare and the look of 
     <span class="hover">terror<span class="translate">恐怖</span></span> that had followed it went from her eyes. 
     They stayed <span class="hover">keen<span class="translate">锐利</span></span> and bright. 
     Her <span class="hover">pulses<span class="translate">脉冲</span></span> beat fast, and the coursing blood warmed and relaxed every 
     <span class="hover">inch<span class="translate">寸</span></span> of her body.</p>
