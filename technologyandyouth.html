      <p>So what <span class="hover">effects<span class="translate">影响,效应</span></span> has the smartphone had? Children who use them do more of everything online (although this may be <span class="hover">partly<span class="translate">部分</span></span> because children who are more <span class="hover">enthusiastic<span class="translate">热情,热心</span></span> about the internet are <span class="hover">keener<span class="translate">热心,浓厚</span></span> to <span class="hover">get hold of<span class="translate">获得,获取</span></span> a smartphone.) But, many children also say they feel they do more online because the <span class="hover">portable<span class="translate">便携,手提</span></span> <span class="hover">device<span class="translate">装置,设备</span></span> was so <span class="hover">convenient<span class="translate">方便,便利</span></span>.</p>
      
      <p>On the <span class="hover">downside<span class="translate">弊端,下行</span></span>, smartphone users were more likely to be <span class="hover">dependent<span class="translate">依赖,依靠</span></span>: Many <span class="hover">acknowledged<span class="translate">应答,确认</span></span> that their internet use meant they spend less time than they should with family, friends or doing schoolwork.</p>

      <div id="questions1">
        <p>(1) What is an advantage of having a smartphone?</p>
        <p>(2) What is the main downside of using smartphones?</p>
        <p>(3) What do YOU think are the main upsides and downsides of having a smartphone?</p>

      <div class="divider">Embracing technology</div>
      
      <p>Technology is not going away. Locking children away from technology until they are adults is not the answer. Why not <span class="hover">shift gear<span class="translate">改变</span></span> to one of <span class="hover">hope<span class="translate">希望</span></span>, <span class="hover">potential<span class="translate">潜力</span></span> and the <span class="hover">pursuit<span class="translate">追求,追逐</span></span> of how to live well with these <span class="hover">devices<span class="translate">装置,设备</span></span>?</p>
      
      <p>This doesn’t <span class="hover">necessarily<span class="translate">一定,必然</span></span> mean listening to all the <span class="hover">advertising<span class="translate">广告,宣传</span></span> about technology and how it can change our lives, but rather taking a <span class="hover">critical<span class="translate">批判性思维</span></span> <span class="hover">approach<span class="translate">方法,办法</span></span> to considering the <span class="hover">benefit<span class="translate">好处,福利</span></span> it holds for our children and how to <span class="hover">achieve<span class="translate">实现,取得</span></span> it.</p>
      
      <p>Part of this is seeing technology from the <span class="hover">perspective<span class="translate">观点,角度</span></span> of children to understand the <span class="hover">value<span class="translate">价值,值</span></span> they find in its use and how this <span class="hover">matches<span class="translate">符合,相符</span></span> our own <span class="hover">goals<span class="translate">目标,目的</span></span> for them as they <span class="hover">grow<span class="translate">增长,长大</span></span> and <span class="hover">develop<span class="translate">发展,制定</span></span>.</p>

      <div class="divider">How Technology Is Changing the Way Children Think and Focus</div>
      
      <p>There is little <span class="hover">doubt<span class="translate">怀疑,疑虑</span></span> that all of the new technologies, led by the Internet, are <span class="hover">shaping<span class="translate">塑造,影响</span></span> the way we think in <span class="hover">obvious<span class="translate">明显</span></span> and <span class="hover">subtle<span class="translate">微妙,细微</span></span>, <span class="hover">deliberate<span class="translate">蓄意</span></span> and <span class="hover">unintentional<span class="translate">无意</span></span>, and <span class="hover">advantageous<span class="translate">有利,优惠</span></span> and <span class="hover">detrimental<span class="translate">有害,不利</span></span> ways. The <span class="hover">uncertainty<span class="translate">不确定性</span></span> is that, with technology being so new, and <span class="hover">developments<span class="translate">变化</span></span> <span class="hover">emerging<span class="translate">出现,形成</span></span> <span class="hover">rapidly<span class="translate">快速,迅速</span></span>, we have neither the <span class="hover">benefit<span class="translate">好处,福利</span></span> of <span class="hover">historical<span class="translate">历史性,</span></span> <span class="hover">hindsight<span class="translate">'后见之明'</span></span> nor the time to <span class="hover">ponder<span class="translate">思考</span></span> the value and cost of these <span class="hover">advancements<span class="translate">提高,进步</span></span> in terms of how it <span class="hover">influences<span class="translate">影响,势力</span></span> our children’s ability to think.</p>
      
      <p>The <span class="hover">effects<span class="translate">影响,效应</span></span> of technology on children are <span class="hover">complicated<span class="translate">复杂</span></span>, with both <span class="hover">benefits<span class="translate">好处,福利</span></span> and <span class="hover">costs<span class="translate">成本,费用,代价</span></span>. Whether technology helps or hurts in the <span class="hover">development<span class="translate">发展,开发</span></span> of your children’s thinking depends on what <span class="hover">specific<span class="translate">具体,特定</span></span> technology is used and how and what frequency it is used. At least early in their lives, the <span class="hover">power<span class="translate">权力,力量</span></span> to <span class="hover">dictate<span class="translate">决定</span></span> your children’s relationship with technology and, as a result, its <span class="hover">influence<span class="translate">影响,势力</span></span> on them.</p>
