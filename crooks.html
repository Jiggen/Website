      <p>Crooks leaned forward over the edge of the bunk. “I ain’t a southern Negro,”
he said. “I was born right here in California. My old man had a chicken ranch,
‘bout ten acres. The white kids come to play at our place, an’ sometimes I went
to play with them, and some of them was pretty nice. My ol’ man didn’t like
that. I never knew till long later why he didn’t like that. But I know now.” He
hesitated, and when he spoke again his voice was softer. “There wasn’t another
colored family for miles around. And now there ain’t a colored man on this
ranch an’ there’s jus’ one family in Soledad.” He laughed. “If I say something,
why it’s just a nigger sayin’ it.”</p>

<p>Lennie asked, “How long you think it’ll be before them pups will be old
enough to pet?”</p>

<p>Crooks laughed again. “A guy can talk to you an’ be sure you won’t go
blabbin’. Couple of weeks an’ them pups’ll be all right. George knows what
he’s about. Jus’ talks, an’ you don’t understand nothing.” He leaned forward
excitedly. “This is just a nigger talkin’, an’ a busted-back nigger. So it don’t
mean nothing, see? You couldn’t remember it anyways. I seen it over an’ over
—a guy talkin' to another guy and it don’t make no difference if he don’t hear or
understand. The thing is, they’re talkin’, or they’re settin’ still not talkin’. It
don’t make no difference, no difference.” His excitement had increased until he
pounded his knee with this hand. “George can tell you screwy things, and it
don’t matter. It’s just the talking. It’s just bein’ with another guy. That’s all.” He
paused.</p>

<p>His voice grew soft and persuasive. “S’pose George don’t come back no
more. S’pose he took a powder and just ain’t coming back. What’ll you do
then?”</p>

<p>Lennie’s attention came gradually to what had been said. “What?” he
demanded.</p>

<p>“I said s’pose George went into town tonight and you never heard of him no
more.” Crooks pressed forward some kind of private victory. “Just s’pose that,”
he repeated.</p>

<p>“He won’t do it,” Lennie cried. “George wouldn’t do nothing like that. I been
with George a long a time. He’ll come back tonight—” But the doubt was too
much for him. “Don’t you think he will?”</p>

<p>Crooks’ face lighted with pleasure in his torture. “Nobody can’t tell what a
guy’ll do,” he observed calmly. “Le’s say he wants to come back and can’t.
S’pose he gets killed or hurt so he can’t come back.”</p>

<p>Lennie struggled to understand. “George won’t do nothing like that,” he
repeated. “George is careful. He won’t get hurt. He ain’t never been hurt, ‘cause
he’s careful.”</p>

<p>“Well, s’pose, jus’ s’pose he don’t come back. What’ll you do then?”
Lennie’s face wrinkled with apprehension. “I don’ know. Say, what you
doin’ anyways?” he cried. “This ain’t true. George ain’t got hurt.”</p>

<p>Crooks bored in on him. “Want me ta tell ya what’ll happen? They’ll take ya
to the booby hatch. They’ll tie ya up with a collar, like a dog.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Lennie’s eyes centered and grew quiet, and mad. He stood up and
walked dangerously toward Crooks. “Who hurt George?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Crooks saw the danger as it approached him. He edged back on his bunk to
get out of the way. “I was just supposin’,” he said. “George ain’t hurt. He’s all
right. He’ll be back all right.”</p>

<p>Lennie stood over him. “What you supposin’ for? Ain’t nobody goin’ to
suppose no hurt to George.”</p>

<p>Crooks removed his glasses and wiped his eyes with his fingers. “Jus’ set
down,” he said. “George ain’t hurt.”</p>

<p>Lennie growled back to his seat on the nail keg. “Ain’t nobody goin’ to talk
no hurt to George,” he grumbled.</p>

<p>Crooks said gently, “Maybe you can see now. You got George. You know
he’s goin’ to come back. S’pose you didn’t have nobody. S’pose you couldn’t
go into the bunk house and play rummy ‘cause you was black. How’d you like
that? S’pose you had to sit out here an’ read books. Sure you could play
horseshoes till it got dark, but then you got to read books. Books ain’t no good.
A guy needs somebody—to be near him.” He whined, “A guy goes nuts if he
ain’t got nobody. Don’t make no difference who the guy is, long’s he’s with
you. I tell ya,” he cried, “I tell ya a guy gets too lonely an’ he gets sick.”
“George gonna come back,” Lennie reassured himself in a frightened voice.
“Maybe George come back already. Maybe I better go see.”</p>

<p>Crooks said, “I didn’t mean to scare you. He’ll come back. I was talkin’
about myself. A guy sets alone out here at night, maybe readin’ books or
thinkin’ or stuff like that. Sometimes he gets thinkin’, an’ he got nothing to tell
him what’s so an’ what ain’t so. Maybe if he sees somethin’, he don’t know
whether it’s right or not. He can’t turn to some other guy and ast him if he sees
it too. He can’t tell. He got nothing to measure by. I seen things out here. I
wasn’t drunk. I don’t know if I was asleep. If some guy was with me, he could
tell me I was asleep, an’ then it would be all right. But I jus’ don’t know.”</p>

<p>Crooks was looking across the room now, looking toward the window.
Lennie said miserably, “George wun’t go away and leave me. I know George
wun’t do that.”</p>

<p>The stable buck went on dreamily, “I remember when I was a little kid on my
old man’s chicken ranch. Had two brothers. They was always near me, always
there. Used to sleep right in the same room, right in the same bed—all three.
Had a strawberry patch. Had an alfalfa patch. Used to turn the chickens out in
the alfalfa on a sunny morning. My brothers’d set on a fence rail an’ watch ‘em
—white chickens they was.”</p>

<p>Gradually Lennie’s interest came around to what was being said. “George
says we’re gonna have alfalfa for the rabbits.”</p>

<p>“What rabbits?”</p>

<p>“We’re gonna have rabbits an’ a berry patch.”</p>

<p>“You’re nuts.”</p>

<p>“We are too. You ast George.”</p>

<p>“You’re nuts.” Crooks was scornful. “I seen hunderds of men come by on the
road an’ on the ranches, with their bindles on their back an’ that same damn
thing in their heads. Hunderds of them. They come, an’ they quit an’ go on; an’
every damn one of ‘em’s got a little piece of land in his head. An’ never a God
damn one of ‘em ever gets it. Just like heaven. Ever’body wants a little piece of
lan’. I read plenty of books out here. Nobody never gets to heaven, and nobody
gets no land. It’s just in their head. They’re all the time talkin’ about it, but it’s
jus’ in their head.”</p>
