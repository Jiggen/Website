      <p>The microwave had just beeped when the lights went out, and the music disappeared. “Perfect timing,” Shoba said. 
      “All I could find were birthday candles.” He lit up the ivy, keeping the rest of the candles and a book of matches by his plate. 
      “It doesn’t matter,” she said, running a finger along the stem of her wineglass. “It looks lovely.”</p>

      <p>In the dimness, he knew how she sat, a bit forward in her chair, ankles crossed against the lowest rung, left elbow on the table. 
      During his search for the candles, Shukumar had found a bottle of wine in a crate he had thought was empty. 
      He clamped the bottle between his knees while he turned in the corkscrew. 
      He worried about spilling, and so he picked up the glasses and held them close to his lap while he filled them. 
      They served themselves, stirring the rice with their forks, squinting as they extracted bay leaves and cloves from the stew. 
      Every few minutes Shukumar lit a few more birthday candles and drove them into the soil of the pot.</p>

      <p>“It’s like India,” Shoba said, watching him tend his makeshift candelabra. 
      “Sometimes the current disappears for hours at a stretch. 
      I once had to attend an entire rice ceremony in the dark. 
      The baby just cried and cried. 
      It must have been so hot.”</p>

      <p>Their baby had never cried, Shukumar considered. 
      Their baby would never have a rice ceremony, even though Shoba had already made the guest list, 
      and decided on which of her three brothers she was going to ask to feed the child its first taste of solid food, 
      at six months if it was a boy, seven if it was a girl.</p>

      <p>“Are you hot?” he asked her. 
      He pushed the blazing ivy pot to the other end of the table, closer to the piles of books and mail, 
      making it even more difficult for them to see each other. 
      He was suddenly irritated that he couldn’t go upstairs and sit in front of the computer.</p>

      <p>“No. It’s delicious,” she said, tapping her plate with her fork. 
      “It really is.” 
      He refilled the wine in her glass. 
      She thanked him.</p>

      <p>They weren’t like this before. 
      Now he had to struggle to say something that interested her, 
      something that made her look up from her plate, or from her proofreading files. 
      Eventually he gave up trying to amuse her. He learned not to mind the silences.</p>

      <p>“I remember during power failures at my grandmother’s house, we all had to say something,” Shoba continued. 
      He could barely see her face, but from her tone he knew her eyes were narrowed, as if trying to focus on a distant object. 
      It was a habit of hers.</p>

      <p>“Like what?”</p>
